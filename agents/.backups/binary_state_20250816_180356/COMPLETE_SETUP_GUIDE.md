# 🚀 COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE - Claude Agents + Voice Input

## ✅ AUTO-BOOT SETUP (Every Claude Code Start)

Your agents will automatically load every time you start Claude Code!

### What Was Set Up:
1. **Environment Variables**: Added to `~/.bashrc`
2. **Auto-initialization**: Script runs on Python startup
3. **Quick Commands**: Available in every terminal session

### Available Commands:

```bash
# Test all agents
claude-test-agents

# Use specific agent  
claude-agent DIRECTOR "plan my enterprise deployment"
claude-agent SECURITY "audit the application security"
claude-agent ARCHITECT "design microservices architecture"

# Run development pipeline
claude-dev-pipeline "path/to/your/code.py"
```

## 🎤 VOICE INPUT SYSTEM

### Basic Voice Commands (Available NOW):

```bash
# Start interactive voice interface
python3 /home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents/basic_voice_interface.py

# Quick single voice commands
python3 -c "
import asyncio
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents')
from claude_agent_bridge import task_agent_invoke

async def voice_cmd():
    result = await task_agent_invoke('DIRECTOR', 'plan my project')
    print(f'Voice result: {result}')

asyncio.run(voice_cmd())
"
```

### Voice Command Examples:

| What You Say | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| **"Claude, ask the director to plan my project"** | → DIRECTOR agent plans your project |
| **"Hey Claude, have security audit the system"** | → SECURITY agent performs audit |
| **"Computer, tell the architect to design an API"** | → ARCHITECT agent creates design |
| **"Agent, get the planner to create a timeline"** | → PLANNER agent builds timeline |
| **"Claude, have the linter review this code"** | → LINTER agent analyzes code |
| **"Ask the patcher to fix the bugs"** | → PATCHER agent applies fixes |

### Interactive Voice Session:

```bash
# Start interactive voice interface
python3 /home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents/basic_voice_interface.py

# Then speak/type commands like:
🎤 Voice Command: Claude, ask the director to plan deployment
🔊 Processing: 'Claude, ask the director to plan deployment'
🎯 Routing to DIRECTOR: plan deployment
✅ DIRECTOR executed successfully
📋 Result: completed
```

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS ON EVERY BOOT:

1. **Claude Code starts** 
2. **Agents auto-load** from environment variables
3. **All agents immediately available** through bridge system
4. **Voice commands ready** for natural interaction

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR SETUP:

### Test 1: Basic Agent Access
```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_bridge import task_agent_invoke

async def test():
    result = await task_agent_invoke("DIRECTOR", "Test system status")
    print(f"Director says: {result}")

asyncio.run(test())
```

### Test 2: Voice Command Processing  
```bash
python3 /home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents/basic_voice_interface.py
```
Then type: `Claude, ask the planner to create a project timeline`

### Test 3: Development Pipeline
```python
from DEVELOPMENT_CLUSTER_DIRECT import DevelopmentCluster

cluster = DevelopmentCluster()
result = cluster.process_file("your_code.py")
print(f"Pipeline result: {result}")
```

## 📂 KEY FILES CREATED:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.bashrc` | Auto-loads agents on terminal start |
| `~/.claude/init_agents.py` | Python startup initialization |
| `~/.claude/agent_config.json` | Agent configuration |
| `basic_voice_interface.py` | Voice command processor |
| `quick_voice.py` | Simplified voice system |

## 🎯 USAGE SCENARIOS:

### Scenario 1: Project Planning
```
You: "Claude, ask the director to plan enterprise deployment"
→ DIRECTOR: Creates strategic deployment plan
→ You get comprehensive project strategy
```

### Scenario 2: Security Review
```  
You: "Hey Claude, have security audit this application"
→ SECURITY: Performs comprehensive security analysis
→ You get vulnerability report and recommendations
```

### Scenario 3: Code Development
```
You: "Claude, have the linter review my code, then patch any issues"
→ LINTER: Analyzes code quality
→ PATCHER: Applies automatic fixes
→ You get improved, clean code
```

### Scenario 4: System Design
```
You: "Computer, tell the architect to design a microservices API"
→ ARCHITECT: Creates system architecture
→ You get technical specifications and design docs
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If agents don't auto-load:
```bash
# Manual load
source ~/.bashrc
export PYTHONPATH="/home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### If voice commands fail:
```bash
# Test basic agent access first
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/ubuntu/Documents/Claude/agents')
from claude_agent_bridge import task_agent_invoke
print('Agents loaded successfully!')
"
```

### If commands not found:
```bash
# Re-source bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
