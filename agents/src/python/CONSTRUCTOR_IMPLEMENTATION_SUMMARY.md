## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Command Set Architecture
```python
# Example: Complex workflow with dependencies
workflow = CommandSet(
    name="Full Application Development",
    type=CommandType.CAMPAIGN,
    mode=ExecutionMode.INTELLIGENT,
    steps=[...],
    dependencies={
        "implementation": ["architecture", "api_design"],
        "testing": ["implementation"],
        "deployment": ["testing"]
    }
)
```

### 2. Agent Auto-Discovery
```python
# Automatic agent registration from file system
agents = orchestrator.discover_agents()
print(f"Registered {agents['total_agents']} agents")
print(f"Capabilities: {agents['agents_by_capability']}")
```

### 3. Execution Mode Selection
```python
# Different modes for different needs
INTELLIGENT    # Smart Python orchestration (DEFAULT)
SPEED_CRITICAL # Maximum performance via C layer
REDUNDANT      # Dual execution for reliability
PYTHON_ONLY    # Library integration support
CONSENSUS      # Both layers must agree
```

### 4. Health Monitoring
```python
# Real-time agent health tracking
health = orchestrator.get_agent_health_status()
# Shows: healthy_agents, unhealthy_agents, individual scores
```

result = await orchestrator.invoke_agent("Director", "create_project_plan")
```

### Complex Workflow Execution
```python
# Multi-step workflow with dependencies
complex_workflow = AdvancedWorkflows.create_full_application_development()
result = await orchestrator.execute_command_set(complex_workflow, use_dag_engine=True)
```

### Agent Discovery
```python
# Find agents by capability
design_agents = orchestrator.agent_registration.get_agents_by_capability('design')
# Returns: ['Director', 'Architect', 'APIDesigner', 'Database']
```
