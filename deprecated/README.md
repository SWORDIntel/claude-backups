**⚠️ WARNING: Do not use code from this directory in new implementations.**

## Contents

This directory may contain:
- Old configuration files and switchers
- Deprecated shell scripts
- Legacy implementations that have been replaced

## Why Keep This?

- Historical reference
- Understanding evolution of the codebase
- Potential recovery of old functionality if needed
- Backward compatibility research

## Migration

If you're looking to migrate from old code:
1. Check the main codebase for updated implementations
2. Refer to migration guides in `/docs`
3. See `/compat` directory for compatibility layers

## Removal
